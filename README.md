ASG1 - The Neighbourhood webpage

This is a webpage made for users who want to buy tickets, view their merch or learn about them. The layout is simple and easy to navigate, guiding visitors through sections such as music, merch, and other curated content. With its use of images, color, and clean HTML/CSS structure, the site reflects a strong sense of branding that follows the bands theme.


Design Process

This webite is for anyone who would like to know more about the band and its history or for fans who would like to purchase their merch or tickets to their concert. This project has a homepage, which has their history and introduction to new members/fan, a ticketing page which also leads to where you can purchase the tickets, and a merch page where you get to see what merch they have. You also get a music page and a clips page where you get to listen to some of their most popluar songs as well as their music videos.
