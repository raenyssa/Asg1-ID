                    The Neighbourhood are a California-based alternative rock band comprised of Jesse Rutherford,
                    Zach Abels, Brandon Fried, Jeremy Freeman, and Mikey Margott. Known for their genre-blending
                    sound and moody aesthetic, the band formed in 2011 and broke through in 2013 with their
                    double-Platinum debut album <em>I Love You</em>.

                    The album features the multi-platinum hit "Sweater Weather," which reached No. 1 on
                    Billboard's Alternative chart. Following the success of their sophomore album <em>Wiped
                        Out!</em> (2015) and a string of EPs, the group continued evolving their sound with
                    <em>The Neighbourhood</em> (2018) and <em>Chip Chrome & the Mono-Tones</em> (2020).

                    With five multi-Platinum, six Platinum, and eight Gold certified singles along with two
                    additional Platinum albums, The Neighbourhood has built a legacy of genre-defining work and
                    are poised to begin a compelling new chapter.
